## Programming Style

For programming in Java we use [Google style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).

## Repository Structure

We focus on the "**Basic Folder Structure**" and for the most text files (such as documentation, README.file, etc.) we are going to use markdown file (.md).
[Learn more](https://medium.com/code-factory-berlin/github-repository-structure-best-practices-248e6effc405). 

## Naming Convention (branches and commits)

Suggested branches naming convetion: `task_number-task_name`.

Commit message naming convention: `task_number if implemented this commit will`.

To get task numbers, use: [Trello Card Numbers Plus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/trello-card-numbers-plus/ncibjlmfhjcjnphnpphgphbflpdpliei/related)

## Documentation

The Swagger implemented by OpenAPI is used for API's documentation.
The documentation can be found under `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html` path by default.
Note that API must be online if you are willing to check the documentation.
